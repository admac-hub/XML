# XML
In one of my previous job i had a task to write a simple code that extracts base64 text from an XML file and decode that to XML then create another XML file by extracting the values needed.   
I`m taking that task further by:
 - Cleaning up my code 
 - Creating Modules
 - Making it dynamic on the filenames 
 - Creating a WorkFlow for the files in mode for the system to always be conistent 
 
 The End Gool is to build a GUI 
 - User friendly 
 - User can chose the file directories 
 - user can upload , download and Archive files as needed
 - User can Chose pick the atributes needed and how he want`s the XML to be created
